abstract: Energy-saving is a hot topic due to the proliferation of climate
  changes and energy challenges globally. However, people's perception about
  using smart technology for energy saving is still in the concept stage. This
  means that people talk about environmental awareness readily, yet in reality,
  they accept to pay the given energy bill. Due to the availability of
  electricity and its integral role, modulating consumersâ€™ attitudes towards
  energy savings can be a challenge. Notably, the gap in today's smart
  technology design in smart homes is the understanding of consumer's behavior
  and the integration of this understanding into smart technology. As part of
  the Paris Climate change agreement (2015), it is paramount for Singapore to
  introduce smart technologies targeted to reduce energy consumption. This paper
  focused on the perception of Singapore households on smart technology and its
  usage to save energy. Areas of current research include (1) energy consumption
  in Singapore households, (2) public programs and policies in energy savings,
  (3) use of technology in energy savings, and (4) household perception of
  energy savings in smart homes. Furthermore, three case studies are reviewed in
  relation to smart homes and smart technology, while discussing the maturity of
  existing solutions.
