The word Smart City has become the branding of most cities today. Cities are competing about who is the "smartest", but in fact, there is no real method to measure this.

You might see many reports being published every year, and each of them make use of their own defined set of indicators. In most cases, it is about the technology being deployed, and the usage of IoT devices and then collecting data from the devices and traffic and weather and people and more. Yes, a city can be considered "smart" when they understand how to analyze and use the data to become *responsive*.

Most of us take our city for granted, and expect to get things or services provided. 

People complain about the government and about their city, when in fact, the people ARE the government and the city. In most countries, people can vote and give ideas and contribute in one way or another. 

When a City gets to understand how to include the citizens view and feedback into the vision and strategy of the city, and when the operation of the city services truly benefit the citizens, then the city becomes responsive and Smart.
